1️⃣ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
✅ Add option to run with or without visualization
→ "headless mode" for batch simulations

✅ Optimize main loop:

Vectorize where possible

Profile and optimize memory field updates

Implement parallelism (threading, multiprocessing) where safe

✅ GPU acceleration:

If possible, add option to use CuPy or OpenCL for:

Memory field updates

Force calculations

2️⃣ FULL GUI (optional but recommended)
✅ Replace console controls with GUI interface (VisPy + PyQt or similar):

GUI should include:

Particle spawning buttons (proton, electron, neutron)

Spin control sliders (per particle type)

Fluid state toggle

Visualization overlay toggles

Play / pause / step buttons

Export / Save button

3️⃣ SIMULATION SAVING & LOADING
✅ Implement Save / Load system:

Save:

Particle positions

Velocities

Spins

Memory field state

Fluid state

Load:

Restore entire simulation state

4️⃣ ADVANCED VISUALIZATION
✅ Add advanced overlays:

Vortex iso-surfaces (field magnitude surfaces)

Curl flow vectors

Spin alignment heatmap

Bond visualization (highlight bonded atoms)

Path trail length control

5️⃣ SCALABILITY TESTING
✅ Add grid scaling parameter:

User can choose grid size:

128³

256³

512³ (if GPU is used)

✅ Test performance and stability at larger grids.

6️⃣ SIMULATION CONFIG FILES
✅ Allow loading a config.yaml or config.json file:

Set initial particles

Initial spins

Fluid state

Grid size

Time step

Logging settings

7️⃣ OUTPUT FORMATS
✅ Support multiple data output formats:

CSV

HDF5 (for large runs)

Optionally VTK for visualization in ParaView

PHASE 3 PRIORITY ORDER:
1️⃣ Performance optimization (headless mode + vectorization)
2️⃣ GPU acceleration
3️⃣ GUI interface
4️⃣ Save / Load system
5️⃣ Advanced visualization
6️⃣ Grid scalability
7️⃣ Config files
8️⃣ Output formats

GENERAL NOTES:
Maintain DWARF-only physics — no classical forces

Ensure atomic unit scaling is preserved

Prioritize performance and stability — goal is to eventually run long DWARF simulations for atomic and molecular tests

Please confirm and proceed to implement Phase 3.
