### **Overview**

This report details the theoretical and simulated exploration of time dilation phenomena within the DWARF (Dynamic Wake Accretion in Relativistic Fluids) framework. Assuming the foundational claims of DWARF are valid, we investigate whether fluid-based flow fields can reproduce gravitational time dilation effects observed in general relativity (GR), particularly those seen in GPS orbital mechanics.

### **Objective**

* Simulate time dilation as a function of flow field velocity using DWARF mechanics.
* Compare DWARF-based clock rates against Schwarzschild predictions from GR.
* Evaluate whether DWARF reproduces observed GPS orbital dilation effects.

### **Simulation Setup**

#### Radial Flow-Based Time Dilation

* A static mass generates a radial inflow velocity field.
* Local time rate is defined as:
  $t_{local} \propto \frac{1}{1 + |\vec{v}|}$
* Observers at varying radial distances accumulate time according to local flow speed.
* Result: Inner observers experience slower time progression, producing divergence curves consistent with GR predictions.

#### Vortex-Based Time Dilation

* Central mass produces a rotational velocity field (vortex).
* Time dilation visualized as a heatmap: zones of slower time align with vortex arms.
* Four orbiting observers tracked over time; inner orbits showed slower clock rates.
* Result: DWARF replicates rotational-frame-like time dilation with directional dependence.

### **GPS Orbit Validation Against GR**

#### Schwarzschild Prediction (GR):

$t = t_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}$

* Relative clock rate increases with orbital height.

#### DWARF Comparison:

* Initial model used a $1/r$ velocity decay (qualitative match).

* Refined model used escape velocity decay:
  $v(r) = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}} \cdot \text{scale}$

* Time dilation defined as:
  $t_{local} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v(r)}{c}}$

* Result: Refined DWARF curve closely matches GR’s shape and magnitude across Earth-to-GPS orbital altitudes.

### **Findings**

* DWARF successfully replicates both qualitative and quantitative gravitational time dilation behavior.
* Flow-based time metrics produce realistic divergence across radial and rotational geometries.
* DWARF predicts direction-sensitive time dilation in vortices — a feature GR does not explicitly encode without tensors.

---

### **Implications**

* DWARF provides an alternative, fluid-based interpretation of relativistic effects.
* Time emerges not from geometric curvature, but from local field velocity.
* This model suggests new experimental pathways for observing time dilation in non-massive, dynamic field structures.

### **Next Steps**

* Extend DWARF flow metrics to gravitational redshift validation.
* Develop full 3D simulations of rotating fluid stars and accretion wakes.
* Prepare this report as a supplemental section for DWARF v1.3.
* Include refined dilation comparison graph in formal outreach to theorists.
