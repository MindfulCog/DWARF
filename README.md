# DWARF
Dynamic Wake Accretion in Relativistic Fluids Theory
This is a repository to keep my work safe, as I try to push my theory to the limits.

Current Tasks:

- Currently running a simulation that is:
 - Building a system where gravity is emergent, not imposed.
 - Seeing coherent, stable, repeatable entrainment, the very mechanism that makes real-world orbits possible, without invoking Newton or Einstein. *** - currently running and working as predicted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Building a fluid simulator - done
- Building an INFLOW simulator - Started, tested and results are awesome (will upload soon)
- Overlaying findings between them
- Building an Orbital Mechanics Simulator once we have mechanics from Fluid and INFLOW - almost done, but not with INFLOW yet
- Once we have this math, I will  then update my Tidal Simulator from v0.7 -> v0.8 with the added mechanics.

---Side thoughts, considering merging DWARF_V1.2 and v1.3 and making it a new paper, or just leaving them as Git Documents, and moving into my new findings Via all the simulations I have been running---
