# DWARF
Dynamic Wake Accretion in Relativistic Fluids Theory
This is a repository to keep my work safe, as I try to push my theory to the limits.

Current Tasks:

Currently running a simulation that is:
 - Building a system where gravity is emergent, not imposed.
 - Seeing coherent, stable, repeatable entrainment, the very mechanism that makes real-world orbits possible, without invoking Newton or Einstein. - currently running and working as predicted.
 - Optimizing with GPU (CUDA) - DONE
 - Results are incredible so far, Next step a full emergent cosmogenesis engine?
 - Paper on results to begin shortly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Getting cupy running on my local machine to utilize GPU for faster sims - Done
- Building a fluid simulator - done
  - Fluid Simulator upgraded to a cupy model with all math findings from INFLOW, Solar, and Tidal sims.  - Testing now.
- Building an INFLOW simulator - Started, tested and results are awesome (will upload soon)
- Overlaying findings between them
- Building an Orbital Mechanics Simulator once we have mechanics from Fluid and INFLOW - almost done, but not with INFLOW yet
- Tidal Simulator updated with math findings, almost producing perfect real  world results using DWARF as primary principle
---Side thoughts, considering merging DWARF_V1.2 and v1.3 and making it a new paper, or just leaving them as Git Documents, and moving into my new findings Via all the simulations I have been running---
