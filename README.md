Dynamic Wake Accretion in Relativistic Fluids Theory
This is a repository to keep my work safe, as I try to push my theory to the limits.

Current Tasks
-Building a fluid simulator
-Building a INFLOW simulator
-Overlaying findings between them
-Building an Orbital Mechanics Simulator once we have mechanics frrom Fluid and INFLOW
-Once we have this math, I will  then update my Tidal Simulator from v0.7 -> v0.8 with the added mechanics.
