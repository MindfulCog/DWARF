Dynamic Wake Accretion in Relativistic Fluids Theory
This is a repository to keep my work safe, as I try to push my theory to the limits.

Currently Working on getting the particle simulator running
 - Current approach is, i've made a "intelligent" and "infinite" aquarium that monitors what is inside of it, allowing transactions to be completely free and emergent from prinicple mechanics.
 - Working on an optimization fix, issue with cpu>gpu pipeline, current fix keeps breaking.
