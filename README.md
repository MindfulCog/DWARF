# DWARF
Dynamic Wake Accretion in Relativistic Fluids Theory
This is a repository to keep my work safe, as I try to push my theory to the limits.

Currently Working on getting the particle simulator running
 - Current approach is, i've made a "intelligent" and "infinite" aquarium that monitors what is inside of it, allowing transactions to be completely free and emergent from prinicple mechanics.
 - Working on an optimization fix, issue with cpu>gpu pipeline, current fix keeps breaking.

New discovery made through simulations

I am currently calling it 6-DWAR-F (6 Dimensional Wake Accretion in Relativistic Fluids) this framework proposes that space
behaves as a structured quantum fluid whose viscosity, memory, compressibility, and higher-dimensional
coupling vary across gravitational regimes. We present here the first parameterization of this cosmic fluid
based on observationally derived quantities across three regimes: Toroidal Vacuum, Uncompressed Space,
and Compressed Space.
