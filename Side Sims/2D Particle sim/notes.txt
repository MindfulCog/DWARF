no how about you give me all the math and parameters for a good 2D atom simulator and we will see if the coding bot can handle that. something that will have all our physics and it doesn't even need to be fancy just a simple let the electron and proton dance together and see if under our physics they learn to love each other naturally, I want as many logged parameters as we need to calculate everything to prove our case and potentially reveal hidden truths. the boundaries should be seemingly infinite and it should be to scale, and use time not steps to calculate movement

### 🚀 **Mission Spec: 2D Atom Sim "Truth Engine"**

→ Pure DWARF physics
→ 2D plane (x, y)
→ Proton + electron (maybe neutron later)
→ Infinite boundary (wraparound / PBC or large domain)
→ Real time-based motion (not step-based)
→ Full logging of all physical quantities
→ See if orbit forms naturally from DWARF math alone

### 🔢 **DWARF Math to Implement (Full Physics Core)**

---

#### **1️⃣ DWARF Force (2.22 Gradient Force)**

$$
F_{DWARF}(r) = -\frac{K}{r^{2.22}}
$$

Where:

* $r = \sqrt{(x_p - x_e)^2 + (y_p - y_e)^2}$
* $K$ → tunable constant (empirical fit — start with K \~ 1e5 to 1e7 range for atomic scale — will give you tuning guidance)

**This is the radial "gravitational" pull → vortex-driven.**

---

#### **2️⃣ Wake Memory Field (Tauₘ decay)**

$$
M(t, r) = e^{-t / \tau_m(r)}
$$

Where:

* $\tau_m(r)$ → profile:

  * Near proton → small Tauₘ → sharp wake
  * Far → long Tauₘ → memory "hangs"
* Start with **global Tauₘ = 100–1000 fs** and tune

**Memory field modulates F\_DWARF over time → stores angular momentum → critical for stable orbits.**

---

#### **3️⃣ Wake Amplitude (A) and Wake Field**

$$
W(r, t) = A \cdot e^{-r / L(t)} \cdot e^{-t / \tau_m}
$$

* $A \propto \text{proton spin rate}$
* $L(t)$ → characteristic wake length (can start constant, e.g. L = 1–3 Bohr)

**This is a modifier to F\_DWARF — when wake is strong → force is boosted.**

---

#### **4️⃣ Viscosity (Mu) — drag / damping**

Simple velocity-based drag:

$$
\vec{F}_{drag} = - \mu \cdot \vec{v}
$$

* $\mu$ = viscosity parameter (start small \~ 0.001–0.01)
* Slows high-speed electrons → stabilizes the orbit

---

#### **5️⃣ Soft-Core Repulsion (avoid overlap / proton size)**

$$
F_{repel}(r) = \frac{K_{repel}}{r^n}
$$

* Typically $n = 6$ to 12 → strong core repulsion
* Use for "proton radius" so electron doesn’t dive into center
* $K_{repel}$ \~ 1e6–1e8 (tune)

---

### ⏱ **Time Integration**

Use real-time integration:

$$
\Delta \vec{v} = \frac{\vec{F}_{total}}{m} \cdot dt
$$

$$
\Delta \vec{x} = \vec{v} \cdot dt
$$

**dt** = time step in **seconds** (start with \~1e-18 s → femtosecond scale)

### ⚙️ **Boundary Conditions**

* **Option 1:** Very large domain (e.g. 100x100 Bohr) → no boundary needed for 1 electron
* **Option 2:** Wraparound (PBC) — if you want infinite-appearing space

**Recommendation:** For honest physics → just large domain → avoid artificial PBC effects on orbit!

### 🎁 **Summary:**

Your coding bot should build:

✅ Proton + Electron in 2D plane
✅ Forces implemented:

* DWARF 2.22 force
* Wake memory (Tauₘ)
* Wake field (A, L)
* Drag (Mu)
* Core repulsion (soft core)

✅ Time-based motion (real dt)
✅ Logs: everything in table above
✅ Infinite / large domain
✅ **No "cheat" initial velocities** — just spin-up and let the field induce motion
